# Factory Workforce Dashboard

## Overview

The Factory Workforce Dashboard is a graph-powered workforce analytics system built using **Neo4j Aura**, **Python**, and **Streamlit**.

This project models factory operations using a graph database and provides an interactive dashboard to monitor:

* workforce allocation
* project tracking
* production relationships
* factory operations analytics

The system transforms traditional CSV-based production data into a connected graph structure using Neo4j.

# Problem Statement

Traditional factory production planning systems often rely on large Excel sheets and disconnected data sources. This makes it difficult to:

* track worker allocation
* identify overloaded resources
* understand project relationships
* analyze factory operations efficiently

This project solves the problem by:

* converting factory datasets into a graph database
* visualizing relationships between workers, stations, projects, and schedules
* providing real-time dashboard insights

---

# Features

## Graph Database Integration

* Uses Neo4j Aura cloud database
* Stores connected factory data as graph relationships
* Models workers, stations, projects, and schedules

---

## Workforce Monitoring

* Displays overworked workers
* Tracks workforce allocation
* Helps identify staffing imbalances

---

## Project Analytics

* Displays factory projects
* Visualizes project-related graph data
* Tracks project scheduling relationships

---

## Interactive Dashboard

* Built using Streamlit
* Modern responsive UI
* Real-time data visualization

# Graph Database Schema

The project models the following entities:

* Worker
* Project
* Station
* Week
* Capacity

Relationships include:

* WORKS_AT
* SCHEDULED_AT
* SCHEDULED_IN

---

# Dataset Used

The dashboard uses factory production datasets provided in CSV format:

* factory_workers.csv
* factory_production.csv
* factory_capacity.csv

These datasets contain:

* worker allocation information
* production schedules
* station assignments
* capacity planning data

# Sample Cypher Queries

## Display Graph Relationships

```cypher
MATCH (n)-[r]->(m)
RETURN n,r,m
LIMIT 50
```

---

## Get Workers

```cypher
MATCH (w:Worker)
RETURN w
```

---

## Get Projects

```cypher
MATCH (p:Project)
RETURN p
```
